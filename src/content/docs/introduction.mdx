### Introduction

Kathford College of Engineering and Management is excited to announce the upcoming three-day hackathon program, Kathcode, scheduled for the 1st to 4th of Ashoj within the college premises. A hackathon is an intensive event where participants collaborate to innovate over a few days. The hackathon will then be followed by a post-event pitching session where participants will present their ideas to the track sponsors and showcase their project as a solution to a real-life problem. The Shark-Tank style pitching session will be held on the 4th of Ashoj, 2082.

The primary goal of Hackathon is to encourage innovation by challenging participants to design, build, and present creative solutions to given problems. The event provides a platform for participants to pitch their final concepts, prototypes, or presentations to stakeholders.
